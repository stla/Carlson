Title: Carlson Elliptic Integrals and Incomplete Elliptic Integrals
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2022-06-28
Author: Stéphane Laurent
Maintainer: Stéphane Laurent <laurent_step@outlook.fr>
Description: Evaluation of the Carlson elliptic integrals and the
    incomplete elliptic integrals with complex arguments. The
    implementations use Carlson's algorithms <doi:10.1007/BF02198293>.
    Applications of elliptic integrals include probability distributions,
    geometry, physics, mechanics, electrodynamics, statistical mechanics,
    astronomy, geodesy, geodesics on conics, and magnetic field
    calculations.
