Title: Carlson Elliptic Integrals and Incomplete Elliptic Integrals
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2020-02-24
Author: Stéphane Laurent
Maintainer: Stéphane Laurent <laurent_step@outlook.fr>
Description: Evaluation of the Carlson elliptic integrals and the incomplete elliptic integrals with complex arguments. The implementations use Carlson's algorithms <doi.org/10.1007/BF02198293>. Applications of elliptic integrals include probability distributions, geometry, physics, mechanics, electrodynamics, statistical mechanics, astronomy, geodesy, geodesics on conics, and magnetic field calculations.
